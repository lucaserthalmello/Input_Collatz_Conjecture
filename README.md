# Input_Collatz_Conjecture
Input any Positive Integer and receives the complete sequence of The Collatz Conjecture.
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
Does the Collatz sequence eventually reaches 1 for all positive integer? This question is an unsolved problem in Mathematics, regardless experimental evidence and heuristic evidence supporting the proof. 
Support the Mathematics knowledge. Using, creating, learning about this simple, but really effective, algorithm is an efficacious study in Mathematics.

Warning:
Please, use this program fully understanding the consequences of a large number on the input, the higher the number in the input, the greater the processing comsumption.
This program has not been tested within numbers such 10(^16) magnitude, that's over 2000 steps depending on the input given.
When I Tried to use this program with a really large number the .py file closed, however, I am not sure what is going to happen with your device. Be cautelous.
